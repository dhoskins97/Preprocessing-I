    <h3>Here's What I've Already Done For Others:</h3>

    <p>McDonald's - 2011 - 2014:<br>
    Being an integral part of the machine that placed #7 out of 14,000 in Amount of Business Handled forged my ability to handle things with efficiency and balance. Some call burger-flipping menial, but it was a crucible that quickened my wit and taught me to love shaving even seconds off of time it takes to complete repetitive tasks.</p>
    
    <p>GEICO - 2015 - 2017:<br>
    Insurance Policy Specialists become masters of creating value for intangible products: a skill that serves me very well today in the market of digital products. Educating the masses on the importance of something you touch or perceive yourself taught me a lesson crucial to engineering products that don't exist without a device to interpret one's work.</p>
    
    <p>Pridgeon & Clay 2018-2019 (Auto Manufacturing/Welding):<br>
    Managing four MIG welders simultaneously is no easy feat, but it quickly became a notch on my belt that brought me to where I am today. Out of several hundred workers, I topped them all in productivity, and became the trump card for the member of highly-competitive management staff under which I operated. Reliability combined with stellar performance is a powerful thing.</p>
